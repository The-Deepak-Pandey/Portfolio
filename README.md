My portfolio website

Completely Responsive website.

I made this website using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although it was a little bit tough task of not using any framework/library or advanced technology for styling like ReactJS or TailWind/Bootstap ... But I took it as a challenge and made something crazyyy.

With this project I learnt the advanced use of DOM in javascript.
